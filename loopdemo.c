/*
    Loop: It is a process which gets repeated again and
    again until the condition doesn't satisfy.

    e.g Circle.

    Every Loop will have 3 important facts.
    1)Initialization  (start)
    2)Conditions  (end)
    3)Updation   (incr/decr)

    In C Programming, we have two types of Loop.

    1) Entry Controlled Loop.
        -There are 2 subloops in it.

        1) while loop
        2) for loop

    2) Exit Controlled Loop.

     we have two rype loops in c progrming
